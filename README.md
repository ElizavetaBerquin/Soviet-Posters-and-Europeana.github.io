# Soviet Posters and Europeana

This website was developed as a part of the thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Digital Humanities, KU Leuven. It visualizes Russian and Soviet posters from the digital collection of Europeana by making API calls. It also presents the results as a digital gallery of art objects sorted by color. This allows to see the collection as a whole and at the same to explore its individual parts and color clusters to discover interesting patterns. Soviet Posters & Europeana was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and aims to adhere to the principles of media visualization proposed by Lev Manovich.
